;;; org-blog.el --- Blog like sitemap for org-publish

;;; Commentary:

;; This program contains a function 'org-blog-export' which can be
;; used by 'org-publish.el' instead of org-publish-org-sitemap. When
;; used, it will use variable 'org-blog-entry-format' to format an
;; entry in the sitemap file. The sitemap file may then be used as an
;; index to the blog.

;;; Code:
