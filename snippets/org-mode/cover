Dear Prof. $1,

I am Pushpendre Rastogi, Ph.D student at Computer Science Department
(Center for Language and Speech Processing, CLSP), working with Prof.
Benjamin Van Durme and Vince Lyzinski.
My research topic is "Recommendations From Knowledge Graphs and Text".

Based on discussion with my advisors, ${2:I or We} will like to ask you to be a
committee member for my GBO Exam (Graduate Board Oral Examination).
The GBO requires 3 committee members from outside of the
department. Since my thesis topic is
related to ${3:what} and you are working on ${4:what} therefore it
will be great if you agree to be on the GBO committee.

The exact schedule has not been determined but it will be some time
this semester, or in early Fall 2017.

GBO (at CLSP) is a kind of preliminary oral exam before starting to
write a Ph.D thesis.
The committee will check if the candidate student is ready to start
his/her research for Ph.D thesis according to the submitted thesis
proposal and 2 hour oral examination.

${5:I or We} will be grateful if you could be a member for my GBO exam,
although we know how busy you must be.
I will also like to explain my current thesis proposal
some time this week or next week (maybe 15-30 mins or so) when you
have time.

For more detailed information about GBO, please email me or see
